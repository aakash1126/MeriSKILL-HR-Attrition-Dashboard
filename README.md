Project Name: HR Attrition Dashboard
Description: In this dashboard, grouping plays a crucial role in organising and presenting the data effectively. The design of the dashboard is tailored to utilize the power of grouping for enhanced data visualization and analysis.

Attrition refers to the gradual reduction or loss of employees in an organization, often stemming from voluntary resignations, retirements or other factors. Understanding and managing attrition is very crucial for maintaining a stable and productive workforce.

I have developed a comprehensive HR Attrition Dashboard utilizing the power of POWER BI. This dashboard offers insightful indicators and factors such as Age, Marital status, Distance from Work, Education, Gender, and more. Understanding and managing attrition is vital for fostering a stable and productive workforce, and this dashboard facilitates precisely that.
With my expertise in data analysis and visualization using POWER BI, I can transform raw data into visually appealing and meaningful insights. By leveraging this tool, I can clean and analyze your organization's data, enabling you to make informed decisions.

Furthermore, I am adept at presenting these findings and recommendations using MS-POWERPOINT, ensuring clear communication and understanding among stakeholders. My goal is to provide actionable insights that contribute to the growth and success of your organization. Feel free to reach out to discuss how I can assist you in optimizing your workforce management strategies.
